# Make-lsp
A Makefile Language server built in C++ and Language client built for VS Code with the aim of making it easier to work with Makefiles

# Features
For now, I would like it to make it easier for me to find the origin and references to Makefile variables in a workspace. This way, I can use shortcuts in the Vs-code editor to find references to variables.

# Goals
- Learn how to implement langauge server by exploring compiler concepts: language parsing, AST generation etc.
- Get better at the C++ language.
- Use data structures and algorithms.
- Finally, make it easier for me to work with Makefiles.
